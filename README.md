# OpenSCAD
OpenSCAD models for Raspberry Pi cases etc.

These are all work in progress. The Raspberry Pi case generator is intended eventually to cover all RPi models and allow a selection of ports to be exposed whilst also providing space internally for any ports that are not exposed. It's mostly for low-power sensor applications where you want an enclosed case that can be securely screwed to a wall. For higher-power applications you will need to include some ventilation.
